# gitHelper
gitHelper is a small bash script that
helps you commit and push to a git repository.

## Usage:
to run it first install it then run it using
````
bash gitHelper.sh
````
./gitHelper.sh wont work because bash will deny its permissions.
when you run it you also have to pass in 2 arguments like this
````
bash gitHelper.sh {file} {message}
````
note: to enter messages use _ as spaces
i_am_a_working_message
'i am a faulty message'
its that way since git throws an error.
