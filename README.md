# gitHelper
gitHelper is a small shell script that
helps you commit and push to a git repository.

## Usage:
to run it first install it then run it using
````Shell
./gitHelper.sh
````
###### you may need to give it permisions using ````chmod +x gitHelper````

when you run it you also have to pass in 2 arguments like 
note: to enter messages use _ as spaces
i_am_a_working_message
'i am a faulty message'
its that way since git throws an error.
